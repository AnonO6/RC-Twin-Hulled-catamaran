# Design features:
1. A twin hull catamaran design ensures utmost stability and compact form factor.
2. A large hollow area ensures less submerged area, reducing dynamic drag.
3. The inward sweeping hull ensures the boat does not unnecessarily move because of inertia of turn, as the sides offer lateral drag.
4. 4. For propulsion, I have decided to go with AirBoat configuration with twin rudders, this ensures-
a) Enough power for impressive speeds.
b) Option to revers the boat, if required.
c) High manoeuvrability with 360 turning ability on its axis.
d) Safe design with minimum exposure of electronics with water.
